## Solr.Finance

Solr.Finance is a decentralized on-chain governance platform.

Solr.Finance plans to build the entire product into a decentralized platform. The founding team will gradually decentralize the product features to the community. Such as product design, website update, and adding new functions to the platform.

## SOLR token

Use the most decentralized method, with equal rights and interests distribution, to attract communities with consistent vision and mission and values ​​to manage the future of the platform and tokens.
